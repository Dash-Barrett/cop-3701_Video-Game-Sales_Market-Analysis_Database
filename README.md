# cop-3701_Video-Game-Sales_Market-Analysis_Database
Project for COP 3701

The main goals of this project is to design a database in which information regarding video game sales can be stored and accessed. Ideally, information such as names, region sales, and genres would be able to be stored and accessible whenever desired, while also being able to add and adjust this information whenever neccessary. A subgoal would also be able to have it easily able to sort through and potentially display trends of sales of certain genres and how they sell in different regions.

The main end users of this database would likely be game data analysts and marketing analysts.
